An Eevorg is a funky presentation of a 1D cellular automaton, with color lookup tables derived the same way as the original FocalFusion pseudo-color lookup tables.  Eevorg "evolve" through a random mutation driven by user choices.

To generate the build solution:

```PS
mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..
```

Generative Software
——————————————————-

TuringPas 1988 had a Text GUI table UI - machine table

TuringPas consider a generative model

CA1D 1991 was GUI for gen model

JuliaB 1992 was GUI for gen model

The EevorgBulbApp 2011 is an MFC + GL application that depicts eevorg as 3D bulbs.

The eevorg collab notebook has a tf generative model of rules.

The eevorg sr colab notebook can be primed from trials google sheet.

Novel eevorg can be found by searching for eevorg that maximizes perceptual distance to example eevorg.

The Eevorg + esrgan models in onnx format are pinned on Pinata.

Eevorg can be 3D printed as a bas relief, and with color.

It is difficult to 3d print removing support.

I can design a Chain mail cap that can be 3d printed.

There is an example pybullet to program hexapod.

CycleGAN for style transfer VAE GAN / CinCGAN:  of CT slices vs VAE; reconstruction, anat0mixer, slice stack pathway.

Eevorg ESRGan 2022 CycleGAN is a generative model.

Different generative models VAE GAN CinCGAN.

An AlexNet or zebrastack mk I or II VAE can be trained on eevorg with 128 latent dimensions.
